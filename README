Virtuoso RDFizer Mapper Scripts
===============================

Copyright (C) 1998-2009 OpenLink Software <vos.admin@openlinksw.com>

This repository is a subset of the OpenLink Virtuoso Open-Source Edition main 
tree, opened for active community development.


Background
==========

The RDFizer (sponger) is a component of OpenLink Virtuoso for extracting
metadata in RDF form, from existing data silos. It does this with several
generic translators (targetting RDFa, GRDDL, eRDF), parsers for standard
formats (RSS, Atom) and scrapers for well-known websites (eg Amazon, Digg,
Flickr, Ebay, Technorati and many more). All these extractors - known as
cartridges - are implemented primarily in the form of XSLT stylesheets.


Development Notes
=================

The aim of developing these XSLT stylesheets is to maximize the quality of
output RDF data. As such, for a given domain, all the obvious data should be
converted, but also mapped onto the greatest number of obvious well-known
ontologies possible.

For example, in the case of a flickr page displaying a photograph, in addition
to any flickr-specific ontology or namespace, the title and description can be
mapped directly to Dublin Core's (DC)'s title and description predicates.
Further, the username can be expressed using either FOAF and/or SIOC, possibly
with some rdfs:seeAlso triples; the structure of image "Sets" and "Collections"
and group "Pools" can be expressed further using SIOC.
